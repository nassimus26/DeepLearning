# Chapter 01: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

This chapter is an introduction to Reinforcement Learning, the basic concepts and the theory behind the framework.

## Examples

Examples of this chapter are:

- Getting started with Gym: [link](Examples/Getting_started_with_Gym.ipynb)
- Getting started with Baselines: [link](Examples/Getting_started_with_Baselines.ipynb)

In this examples you will practice with Gym and Baselines, the two main RL libraries.

## Exercises

Here you can find all exercises of this chapter:

- Toy Environment: [link](Exercise01_01/Exercise01_01.ipynb)
- Policies: [link](Exercise01_02/Exercise01_02.ipynb)
- Creating a Space for Image Observations: [link](Exercise01_03/Exercise01_03.ipynb)
- Implementing the Reinforcement Learning Loop with Gym: [link](Exercise01_04/Exercise01_04.ipynb)

In these exercises you will practice with concepts like Agent, Environment, Policy. 

## Activity

The activity of this chapter is:

- Measuring the Performance of a Random Agent: [link](Activity01_05/Activity01_05.ipynb)

In the activity you will implement a basic RL loop measuring the performance of an agent acting randomly.
